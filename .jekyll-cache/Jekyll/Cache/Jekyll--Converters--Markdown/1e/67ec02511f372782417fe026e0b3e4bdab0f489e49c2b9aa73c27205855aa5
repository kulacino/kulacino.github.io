<p>Hi Fellas!</p>

<p>Well, it‚Äôs been hard for me today. Since 2PM (Monday, 11 May 2020), i‚Äôve been working on my urgent to-do-list.
You can‚Äôt imagine‚Ä¶. me‚Ä¶. being busy the whole day, while PLN seems to be annoying and cut Kuripan‚Äôs area electricity.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been migrating my blogspot or blogger <del>if you prefer to choose that terms</del>, into a more simple and light platform. I tried several flat-file CMS before, such as GRAV, Automad, BatFlat, etc, but nothing satisfies me. I continue to search for a better solution and I had a crush with this guy, named <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Served under ruby and its rubygems. And before I notice, for the past 12 hours, I sat in front of my laptop, while fasting, and exhaust my own brains just to make it work.</p>

<h1 id="hi-yu-whats-jekyll">Hi, Yu! What‚Äôs Jekyll?</h1>
<p>Some of you maybe familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>‚Äôs character, but Jekyll that i mentioned here is not Dr. Jekyll. I‚Äôm using Github Pages for now (and maybe will continue to do so), with Jekyll inside. Jekyll works as some kind of backend. For you who aren‚Äôt familiar with Jekyll, maybe wouldn‚Äôt want to try this platform, ever‚Ä¶ Jekyll is robust and it could transform your plain text into a a static sites and even a blog pages. But, you might waste a lot of time while migrating and re-decorating your new site under Jekyll.</p>

<p>Using Github Pages means you could use markdown language which easy to learn <del>easier than HTML and it‚Äôs easier to said ‚Äúit‚Äôs easy‚Äù while you‚Äôve been whining all the time about ‚Äúsyntax error‚Äù</del>. So, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this platform if you don‚Äôt have time to learn and fixing all the error.</p>

<h1 id="reason-for-migrating">Reason for Migrating</h1>
<p>The reason is as simple as my new blog theme. I only want to start a new, a fresh, a more minimalistic life. Of course it applies to my blogging life too. I‚Äôm fed up with Blogger already, even though I used it since 2009. I also used Wordpress around 2017 - 2018, but I can‚Äôt keep up with the payment. <em>God Bless my wallet!</em> And another reason is‚Ä¶ I love markdown language! I even contribute to some tech wikis in the past and amazed with the fast loading of its content and images.</p>

<h1 id="tutorial">Tutorial?</h1>
<p>Well, this post is only a celebration to the success of Jekyll deployment by me! I‚Äôll keep you update with the tutorial of Blogger to Github Pages migration, but not today‚Ä¶ And I should warn you beforehand that the tutorial will have its complexity at its best. :sunglasses:</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em></p>

  <li>Oh well, so cool! Github Pages also support emojis, you know?</li>
  <li>I also create some codes and automations in my spare time. Visits <a href="https://github.com/kulacino">Kulacino</a> to use my code freely.</li>
