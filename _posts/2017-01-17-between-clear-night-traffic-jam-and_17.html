<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Between the Clear Night, Traffic Jam, and Hypocrisy </b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />“Do you know what Minangkabau means?”</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">“I don’t know.”</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />“I bet that Kabau means ‘Kerbau’?”</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />And  he laughs. It’s not as expensive as the all jewelry in Cikini gold  center, but it’s meaningful. And we spend the night, go through all the  sidewalk, find the cheapest and the best coffee shop. Just to talk about  random things. About non sense.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />“Look, it’s a cafe. I didn’t bring my eyeglasses, so could you read the menu that written on the wall?”</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />“Where?” he asks.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />“There.” I pointed my finger to the cafe while saying that. I really can’t read anything, since i have myopia. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />He  really look at the cafe, and mention all the menu that written on the  cafe’s wall. Like a fool, we stood for a long time in front of the cafe.  Because there’s no coffee or any interesting things, we continue our  journey. It’s eight o’clock already, but I think it’s too early to  sleep, since the sky was so clear. I think it’s best to take a walk and  talk about randomness.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />As we reach the main street, with trucks,  cars, buses, and peoples, I began to sing. It’s Vindicated, you know?  One hit that Dashboard Confessional made. I don’t even know why I’m  singing that song, but It’s good. I feel like the energy and the sky  already meet. It’s like a show.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />So, I said, “The street is my stage. Well, what is Vindicated exactly?”</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />“I don’t know. Hmm, vin--di--ca--ted?”</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />“It’s strange, isn’t it? We sing a song that we don’t know what it means. But we enjoyed it,” said I.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />“Maybe it’s just a good song,” he replies.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />He  laughs again. I can’t see him laughing, but I knew it. Every time he  laughs, his eyes turn to a line, with no eyelid. And he always said that  he is a Chinese, with that eyes. But it doesn’t matter, since he is the  one that give me applause in the middle of a traffic jam.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />People may  say that we’re just a fool. But we enjoyed it. As we say, this street  is our stage. And then he said, “Ah! I forgot to bring my feather  duster.” </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />“Just forget it, we can start cleaning the vehicles with your jacket! But, is it your jacket our my jacket?”</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">"Just said that is it ours, since you gave this to me and I'm the one that wearing this."</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />And  we laugh again. I don’t know exactly what is so funny, but since this  night is still early to sleep, let’s just enjoy the journey. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />***</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />As we reach the Salemba’s sidewalk, we began to think about, “Where is the shadow?”</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />Ah,  we forgot that the sidewalk’s lamp is on the right side of us, so our  shadow should be at our back. And we played a games about <i>‘Guess where  is our shadow?’</i>. And someone is following us and it turns to be a  pedestrian that dodge us. Maybe he thinks that we’re crazy? And what is  craziness anyway? Is it us or them that crazy? We don’t even know, since  every reality and imagination in this big city was scattered and mixed  up.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />It’s not the first time we walked around every pedestrian  sidewalk, to somewhere, or to search for something. But it’s been a  pleasure to waste a tight time in Jakarta like this. People can be so  busy and can’t think about anything but weariness. But for me and him, a  clear night skies is just a good time for us to talk outside, not  always over coffee. The clear sky guided us to every corner that’s good.  And just like every walking tour that I spend with him, it’s always  meaningful. It’s always been beautiful. I may ended up crying, or  talking about some randomness and hypocrisy over my life, but the  beginning of this stories was always good.</span><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">And  in the cheap coffee shop that we finally reached, I asked a question,  "Why do we still calm when we're going to be married next month?"</span><br /><br />"It's just a marriage, right? And we will cherish all the surprises that we might find."<br /><br />"Yeah, we will. We do."</div></div>
